# Now that you know there are strings, integers, and decimals as variables,
# it's time to see what you can do with them.
# In the case of strings, you can't do much except concatenate them.
# Example:
name = "Dirk"
person_number = "4"
name_and_person_number = name + person_number  # name_and_person_number = "Dirk4"

# In the case of integers and decimals, you can do much more:
# Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, modulo, and exponentiation:
value1 = 8
value2 = 2
added = value1 + value2  # added = 10
subtracted = value1 - value2  # subtracted = 6
multiplied = value1 * value2  # multiplied = 16
divided = value1 / value2  # divided = 4
modulo = value1 % value2  # modulo = 0 because 8 / 2 = 4 remainder 0
power = value1 ** value2  # power = 64

# Integers can always be converted to strings; in that case, the number is seen as a word.
# Strings can sometimes be converted to integers, but only if it represents a number.
# Conversion between integers and strings is done as follows:
int_person_number = int(person_number)
str_value1 = str(value1)

# Things you need to know now:
#  Convert to strings
#  Convert to integers
#  Arithmetic with integers
#  Concatenate strings

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercises you should be able to do now.
# 1) Create a variable 'age' as a string. Ensure that this variable represents your
#    age in string form. Then show how you can convert the variable to an integer.
# 2) Make it possible to perform calculations with two numbers. For that, create two variables:
#    one variable for number1 and the other variable for number2.
#    Then print out the sum and multiplication of the two numbers.
