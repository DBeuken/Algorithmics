# In this section, we'll be discussing variables.
# Variables are essentially containers: they store information.
# For instance, I can create a variable named 'name' with the value 'Dirk'.
# I do it as follows:
name = "Dirk"

# In this case, I've created a variable named 'name' with the value 'Dirk'.
# I can also write it like this:
name = 'Dirk'

# In the above examples, I created a string.
# A string is essentially a word.
# Examples of strings are as follows:
car_brand = "Peugeot"
favorite_dish = "pizza"
color = "green"

# The values of strings are always indicated with quotation marks.
# Double quotation marks on both sides or single quotation marks on both sides do not matter.
# In the above cases, it's always about strings (words), but we also have numbers.
# Whole numbers are also called integers.
# Examples of integers are:
age = 22
favorite_number = -7
number_of_bikes = 2

# Finally, there are also decimals.
# These are numbers that are not whole numbers.
# Examples of these are:
grade = 7.4
negative_value = -10

# The interesting thing about variables is that you can change the value during the code.
# So, you can confidently say:
age = 22
age = 23

# The name of the variable is always one word and can consist of letters, capital letters,
# underscores, and numbers, among other things. So, a variable name like 'Person3' and 'Person_3'
# is allowed, but a variable name like '234' is not allowed.

# Exercises you should be able to do now
# 1) Create a variable for your name, a variable for your age, and a variable for your hobby.
#    Change the value of the hobby variable during the code.
