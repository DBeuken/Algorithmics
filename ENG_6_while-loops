# Here I discuss while-loops.
# While-loops are a way to repeat a piece of code.
# The previous chapter discussed for-loops. This is where while-loops come into play.
# while-loops are for when you want to repeat a piece of code,
# but you don't know yet how often you want to repeat.
# Suppose you are presented with a calculation problem and you want it to be tried again
# until the answer is correct:
result = 8
answer = int(input("What is 5 + 3?"))
while outcome != answer:
     print("Wrong answer, please try again.")
     answer = int(input("What is 5 + 3?"))

# If you run this program above, you will see that it can be over after one answer,
# but that it can also take an infinitely long time.
# As you can see, the while-loop continues as long as the outcome is not equal to the answer.
# If you look closely, you'll see that the while loop looks a bit like an if statement.
# Just like the if statement, the while-loop has a condition, in this case
# that the result is not equal to the answer.
# The big difference is that the if-statement is executed only once, and the while loop is executed the same way
# long if the condition is true.


# You can also write a program that continues until you say "stop".
# For example:
answer = ""
while answer != "stop":
     answer = input("Enter something (stop = end):")
     print("You entered:", answer)


# You could also use "True" with a break-statement to get a while-loop working.
# For example:
while True:
     answer = input("Enter something (stop = end):")
     print("You entered:", answer)
     if answer == "stop":
         break
    
# The example above shows "while True". This means that the while-loop will always
# keep going unless a "break" truncates the while loop.
# The above example also shows that if-statements can be in while loops.
# Furthermore, if-else statements, for loops, other while loops, etc. can all be in a while loop.


# Things you need to know now:
# while-loop
# while(True)
# break

# Assignments you should now be able to complete:
#1) Ask someone what year Einstein was born.
# Then make sure that the person has to keep entering a year until the answer is correct (correct = 1879).
# If the answer is correct, you must print out: "Good answer!"
# If the answer is incorrect, you should say: "Wrong, try again"
