# In Python, we often use if-statements.
# These are moments when you say: "If [THIS] happens, then do [THAT]".
# For example:
age = 19
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")

# In the above example, "Adult" is printed only if you are older or as old as 18.
# If you are not that old, nothing happens. The part "age >= 18" is called the condition.
# What is under the if-statement is called the 'if-statement body'.
# The body is marked by an indentation on each line, so it's clear which lines belong
# to the if-statement and which are outside.

if age > 10:
    print("This is the body of the if statement")
    print("This is also in the body")
print("This is outside the body of the if-statement")

# Whether you enter the body of the if-statement depends on the condition:
# Based on the condition of the statement, the body is approached or not.

# Besides if-statements, there are also if-else statements. These are statements
# where you still enter the else-body if the if-statement is not true.
# Example:

if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Child")

# Note that the body of the if-statement also has an indentation removed with "else"!
# Also, note that there is no statement after "else"! A ':' immediately follows.

# There are also if-elif-else statements:

if age >= 65:
    print("Elderly")
elif age >= 18 and age < 65:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Child")

# If the if-statement above is correct, the body of 'if' is executed, and the body
# of 'elif' and 'else' is ignored.
# If the elif-statement is correct, only the body of 'elif' is executed.
# If the if-statement and elif-statement are incorrect, only the body of 'else' is executed.

# The elif-statement is formulated as an if-statement and thus has a condition.

# Finally, you can also include multiple conditions in 1 if-statement or elif-statement.
# You can do this using 'or' and 'and'.
# 'and' means that both statements must be true to enter the if-body.
# 'or' means that at least one of the two statements must be true to enter the if-body.
# For example:
if age >= 10 and age < 20:
    print("Teenager")

# In the above example, "Teenager" is printed only if you are at least 10 years old and less than 20 years old.
# "Teenager" is printed only if both conditions are met.


# Things you should have learned:
#  if-statement
#  if-else statements
#  if-elif-else statements
#  if-body
#  elif-body
#  else-body
#  and (in if-statement or elif-statement)
#  or (in if-statement or elif-statement)
#  condition

# Exercises you should be able to do now:
# 1) Create a variable to store your name.
#    Print "You are Timo!" if your name is equal to "Timo".
# 2) Create a variable named "wallet". Put in it how much money is in the wallet (e.g., 200 for 200 euros).
#    Print "Rich" if there is more than 500 euros in it.
#    Print "Reasonably rich" if there is between 200 and 500 euros.
#    Print "Poor" if there is less than 200 euros.
#    Also, try adjusting the amount in the wallet to see which body (if-body, elif-body, else-body)
#    you end up in.
