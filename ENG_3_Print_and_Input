# In Python, you can print things and also request input.
# Printing is done as follows:
print("This is printed")
name = "Dirk"
print("Hello, my name is", name)

# In this case, the comma is interpreted as a space.
# If you don't want to add an extra space, you can use a +:
print("Hello, my name is" + name)

# In Python, input is requested as follows:
name = input("Your name: ")

# In this case, what is between quotation marks is printed,
# and then you have to enter something.
# What you enter is stored in the variable 'name'.
# Note that Python input always assumes you are providing a string.
# If you prefer to receive a number, you need to convert the input value
# to an integer:
age = int(input("Your age: "))
print("In a year, you will be", age + 1, "years old!")


# Things you need to know now:
# print()
# input()


# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercises you should be able to do now:
# 1) Print an introduction about yourself. For example:
#    "Hello, I am Dirk, and I am 23 years old."
# 2) Ask how old someone is. Then print out how old that person
#    will be in 5 years.
